## About

**Poker Time** from the start is built to be a free, open source, and simple application for running small scale home poker tournaments. I started running poker tournaments with a few of my friends in 2024. When we first started playing, finding the right timer was a challenge. We would run a timer on our phones or in a web browser, but this was not a perfect solution. I would need to reference the spreadsheet in another tab to keep track of the blinds. This was clunky and slowed down the pace of the game. So I decided to build my own timer which would serve all our needs at once.

## Features

**Poker Time** can keep track of all aspects of your game. It knows what round it is, how long that round is, big blind, and small blind. This makes running a tournament match simple by keeping track of all this stuff so you can focus on playing the game.

To start a game you'll need to set up your game first. When you first press the `Start Game` button from the landing page you'll be taken to the game editor page. First choose how many rounds you want for your game, then press save game to populate the rows. Then fill out the rest of the options as desired. When you're ready press `Start Game` to start the game.

If you already have a game file you want to import such as `Sample_Game.csv` from the release page on github. You can press the `Import Game` button and select the file from the file browser pop up window. Additionally you can create your own game files by pressing the `Export Game` button.

Once you are on the game page the controls should be pretty straightforward. Press `Start Timer` to start the timer, and if the timer is running you can press `Pause Timer` to pause. The `Next Round` button takes you to the next round. The `Options` tab has a variety of fuctions. You can start a new game, edit your current game, restart the game, and more.
